## P02 - No Path Still
### Joshua Williams
### Description:

To use NetworkX and create a fully connected graph between all the cities, without using roads, and simply connecting each city "as the crow flies" using straight lines. Going to use UFO sightings as a metric for which cities to visit. Basically visit cities with lots of UFO sightings before visiting cities that had fewer UFO sightings.
