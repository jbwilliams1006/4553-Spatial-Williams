## P05 - Spatial Game API
### Joshua Williams
### Description:

Creates routes that do the following:
Gets a single polygon from the countries geojson data, the polygon that best represents the countries border.
Get a list of country names that could be used to display to a user.
Get a list of country "suggestions" as determined by a partial string match to a key value sent from the user.
Get a point that represents the center of a polygon to help in a distance calculation between countries.
Get the distance between:
Two points
Two polygons (implemented preferably as discussed in class)
Get a hint from the api (returns the "continent" that the goal country resides on (in?)).
Any other routes you may need to help run the game.
